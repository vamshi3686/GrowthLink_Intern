Iris Flower Classification

About this Project

This project is about classifying Iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — based on their sepal and petal measurements.
It uses Machine Learning algorithms to learn from the famous Iris dataset and predict the species of a flower given its measurements.

I trained and tested the model using the four key features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width


The main goal of this project was to build a simple classification model, visualize the dataset, and understand how different features affect prediction.



What this Project Includes:

Data cleaning and exploration

Data visualization using graphs

Model training

Model evaluation and testing

Prediction on new data



Dataset

The dataset used is the classic Iris dataset.
